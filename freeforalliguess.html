    <h1>Which NBA team has the best odds of winning the 2020 title?</h1>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9TZ2_0OGHaU/maxresdefault.jpg"/>
    <p>The 2019 - 2020 NBA season will be kicking off today October 22nd with the Los Angles Lakers vs the Los Angles Clippers <br>
      at 10:00pm EST and the New Orleans Pelicans vs the Toronto Raptors at 7:30 EST. All NBA fans are bursting with excitment <br>
      for this season as for the first time in years we don't have a clear cut winner. The Golden State Warriors were an all <br>
      time team in 2016 (broke the NBA record for most wins with a record of 73-9) but were ultimately dismanteled by <i>Lebron James</i> <br>
      and the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. They then added <i>Kevin Durant</i> in 2017 and were unstoppable until recently when they lost <br>
      the 2019 championship to the Toronto Raptors. However, the warriors aren't the same team they once were anymore, and with <br>
       many teams adding star players to their roster, it's going to be a dog fight for the championship this year.</p> <br>

      <h3>Los Angles Lakers</h3>
      <p>The Los Angles Lakers have a lot of things going for them ever since they pulled the block buster trade making <br>
         <i>Anthony Davis</i> a laker. One of them being, they're one of the favorites to win it all this year. With many <br>
         teams scoring big in free agency, the Lakers also did their fair share; adding guys such as <i>Danny Green</i>, <br>
         <i>Dwight Howard</i>, <i>Avery Bradely</i>, and <i>Quinn Cook</i> while retaining some of the guys from last year.</p> <br>
      <strong>Pros:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Kyle Kuzma</i> coming off the bench</li>
        <li>Play Big</li>
        <li>Defense</li>
        <li>Lots of shooting</li>
        <li>Great Spacing</li>
      </ol>
      <strong>Cons</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Minimal Deph</li>
        <li><i>Lebron</i> being 34 going on 35</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Los Angles Clippers</h3>
      <p>The Los Angles Clippers became instant title contenders when they signed both <i>Paul George</i> and <i>Kawhi Leonard</i>. <br>
        They are currently the favorites to win the Championship, however that doesn't mean they're untouchable.</p> <br>
      <strong>Pros</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Deph</li>
        <li>Defense</li>
        <li>Shooters</li>
        <li>Loaded with talent</li>
      </ol>
      <strong>Cons</strong>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Paul George</i> and the concerns around his injury</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Golden State Warriors</h3>
      <p>The Warriors are interesting. They lost <i>Kevin Durant</i> in free agency, and <i>Klay Thompson</i> is <br>
         currently injured and is most likely out for the season. However, they did manage to snag <i>D'Angelo Russell</i> <br>
         from the Booklyn Nets. Although <i>D'Angleo Russell</i> is a good addition, he doesn't solve their newfound <br>
         defensive problems. Yes, they have scoring, however they are going to let up a lot of points; <br>
         which is going to lead to losses.</p>
         <strong>Pros</strong>
         <ol>
           <li>Scoring</li>
           <li>Shooting</li>
         </ol>
         <strong>Cons</strong>
         <ol>
           <li>Horrible Defense</li>
           <li>Curry reliant</li>
           <li>No depth</li>
           <li>Lacking bigs</li>
         </ol>

        <h3>Philidelphia 76ers</h3>
        <p>The 76ers have always been a few peices from becoming a true title contender. Throughout the past 2 or <br>
          so years they've been hovering a little above average. However, this season with the resigning of <br>
          <i>Tobias Harris</i>, <i>Ben Simmons</i>, and the additions of <i>Al Horford</i> and <i>Josh Richardson</i>; they have a <br>
          serious team. However, the question that will always come up is: "Can <i>Joel Embiid</i> stay healthy?" <br>
          <i>Joel Embiid</i> is their best player however, he's extremely injury prone, and that can be a liability come <br>
          playoff time.</p>
          <strong>Pros</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Strong Starting 5</li>
            <li>Great Defense</li>
            <li>Very tall which can be a problem for some teams</li>
          </ol>
          <strong>Cons</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Not much shooting</li>
            <li>Very top heavy</li>
            <li>Depth is questionable</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Milwaukee Bucks</h3>
          <p>The Bucks suffered a little over the offseason by losing <i>Malcolm Brogdon</i>. He was their elite floor <br>
            spacer and 3pt shooter. However they were able to somewhat replace him with <i>Kyle Korver</i> and <i>Wesley Matthews</i>. <br>
            It's obvious what the Bucks are trying to do. They are trying to surround <i>Giannis</i> with as much shooting <br>
            as possible, and did they do it? Yes. Although, with the loss of <i>Macolm Brogdon</i>, this puts more weight <br>
            on <i>Kris Middleton</i> to produce the same or better all star numbers he showed last year. I'm not reall worried <br>
            about <i>Giannis</i> because we all know he's going to get his 30pts, 11reb, and 8ast nightly.</p> <br>
          <strong>Pros</strong>
          <ol>
            <li><em>Giannis</em></li>
            <li>3pt shooting</li>
            <li>Defense</li>
          </ol>
          <strong>Bench</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Bench</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Houston Rockets</h3>
          <p>The Rockets had their run with <i>Chris Paul</i>. They had 2 partly sucessful years with <i>Chris Paul</i>. <br>
            Yes, they won many games (65 the first season and 53 the second). However, with failure with bring home <br>
            a championship in either years, its hard to call these years a success. So, the Rockets went <br>
            out and traded their star point guard <i>Chris Paul</i> to aqquire <i>Russell Westbrook</i>. The addition of <br>
            <i>Russell Westbrook</i> could be the change the Rockets needed; as Paul was getting up there in years <br>
            and was past his prime, while on the other hand you have a prime <i>Russell Westbrook</i> hungry for a <br>
            title. They also live and die by the 3, which could cost them games as it did in the 2018 playoffs <br>
            again the Golden State Warriors.</p>
            <strong>Pros</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>3pt shooting</li>
              <li>Playmaking</li>
              <li>Spacing</li>
              <li>Pace</li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Cons</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Depth</li>
              <li>Injuries</li>
              <li>Closing out games</li>
              <li>3pt reliant</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Brooklyn Nets</h3>
            <p>The Brooklyn were one of the big winners this free agency. There were able to steal both <i>Kyrie Irving</i> <br>
             (via Celtics) and <i>Kevin Durant</i> (via Golden State). However they did have to give something up though. <br>
             The Warriors took <i>D'Angelo Russell</i> from the Nets becuase they refused to be left empty handed. <br>
             Unfortunately for Nets fans, they won't feel these improvements until the 2020-21 NBA season. With <br>
             <i>Kevin Durant</i> being out with achilles injury, <i>Kyrie</I> can only take them so far. I think we'll see a similar <br>
             5-6th seed Nets team as we saw last year.</p>
             <strong>Pros</strong>
             <ol>
               <li>Talent filled roster</li>
               <li>Shooter</li>
               <li>Rim Defenders</li>
               <li>Great Depth</li>
             </ol>
             <strong>Cons</strong>
             <ol>
               <li><em>Kevin Durant</em> injury (for now)</li>
               <li>Talent wins games, but teamwork wins championships</li>
               <li>locker room problems</li>
             </ol>
